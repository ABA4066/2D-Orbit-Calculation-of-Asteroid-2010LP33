2D Orbit Calculation of Asteroid 2010LP33

We've been given a Asteroid 2010LP33 with **semi-major axis (a) of 381515710.2 km**, **eccentricity (e) 0.42**, **with a crossing time of 2458344.2343327492 JD**, **with a period of 128825856 seconds** and assumed to move only in **two dimensions** is given **Me/2pi (Orbital phase)**, **E (External Anomaly)**, **r (Distance)**, **v (True Anomaly)** for each desired day and moment (must be in **JD** units). **The Newton-Raphson** method was applied to solve the **Kepler Equation** to a precision of **10^-6**. 

The Python and Matlab code does the same job. The second Matlab code makes the time in a period of 1 period at 10 days intervals and plots the orbit in Polar coordinates with the obtained v (True anomaly) and r (Distance) data. In the Excel spreadsheet with each monthly data obtained from the Pyton code, the same orbit is plotted using Cartesian coordinates.
